collections_rewrite
===================

A learning exercise: rewrite the collections java framework.

I thought this would be a good way to learn some fundamental Java. We can take turns writing tests and making them pass while emerging a rewrite of the java collections framework.

You will need Java and Maven for this project, or possibly just a modern IDE like Eclipse or Intellij. Check out the project and make the failing build pass.
